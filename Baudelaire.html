<p> Who among us has not dreamt, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and staccato enough to adapt to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the undulations of dreams, and sudden leaps of consciousness. This obsessive idea is above all a child of giant cities, of the intersecting of their myriad relations.</p>

<p>
Charles Pierre Baudelaire(April 9, 1821 - August 31, 1867) was a French poet who also produced notable work as an essavist art critic and pioneering translator of Edgar Allan Poe.
Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and St&#233phane Mallarm&#233 among many others. He is credited with coining the term "modernity" (modernit&#233) to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience.
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire's influence on the direction of modern French (and English) language literature was considerable. The most significant French writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, Arthur Rimbaud praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'. In 1895, St&#233phane Mallarm&#233 published a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory, 'Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire'. Marcel Proust, in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with Alfred de Vigny, Baudelare was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.

<p>
Baudelaire was born in Paris, France, on April 9, 1821, and baptized two months later at Saint-Sulpice Roman Catholic Church.
His father, Fran&#231ois Baudelaire, a senior civil servant and amateur artist, was 34 years older than Baudelaire's mother, Caroline. François died during Baudelaire's childhood, in 1827. The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts.
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire was educated in Lyon, where he boarded. At fourteen he was described by a classmate as "much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils." At the time he already expressed his precocious love of literatures.
Later, he attended the Lyc&#233e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, studying law. During the time, he began to frequent prostitutes and run up debts, mostly for clothes. In 1839, he gained his degree. His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career.

<p>
His stepfather sent him on a voyage to Calcutta, India, in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits. The trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry.
On returning to the taverns of Paris, he began to compose some of the poems of "Les Fleurs du Mal".
At age of 21, he received a sizable inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years. His family obtained a decree to place his property in trust.
</p>

<p>
He took part in the Revolutions of 1848 and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper. However, his interest in politics was passing, as he was later to note in his journals.
In the early 1850s, Baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output. He often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors. He undertook many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by Edgar Allan Poe.
</p>

<p>
Upon the death of his stepfather in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. At 36 he wrote her: "believe that I belong to you absolutely, and that I belong only to you".
</p>

<p>
By 1859, his illnesses, his long-term use of laudanum, his life of stress and poverty had taken a toll and Baudelaire had aged noticeably. But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at Honfleur.
In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of Richard Wagner.
</p>

<p>
His financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the rights to his works and also to give lectures.
The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in "maisons de santé" in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse, Paris.

<p>
Les Fleurs du mal, in English: The Flowers of Evil) is a volume of French poetry by Charles Baudelaire. First published in 1857 (see 1857 in poetry), it was important in the symbolist and modernist movements. The poems deal with themes relating to decadence and eroticism.
</p>

<p>
The initial publication of the book was arranged in six thematically segregated sections:
</p>
<p>
Spleen et Id&#233al (Spleen and Ideal)
</p>
<p>
Tableaux parisiens (Parisian Scenes)
</p>
<p>
Le Vin (Wine)
</p>
<p>
Fleurs du mal (Flowers of Evil)
</p>
<p>
R&#233volte (Revolt)
</p>
<p>
La Mort (Death)
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire dedicated the book to the poet Th&#233ophile Gautier, describing him as a parfait magicien des lettres fran&#231aises ("a perfect magician of French letters")
</p>

<p>
Baudelaire's section Tableaux Parisiens, added in the second edition (1861), is considered one of the most formidable criticisms of 19th-century French modernity. This section contains 18 poems, most of which were written during Haussmann's renovation of Paris. Together, the poems in Tableaux Parisiens act as 24-hour cycle of Paris, starting with the second poem Le Soleil (The Sun) and ending with the second to last poem Le Cr&#233puscule du Matin (Morning Twilight). The poems featured in this cycle of Paris all deal with the feelings of anonymity and estrangement from a newly modernized city. Baudelaire is critical of the clean and geometrically laid out streets of Paris which alienate the unsung anti-heroes of Paris who serve as inspiration for the poet: the beggars, the blind, the industrial worker, the gambler, the prostitute, the old and the victim of imperialism. These characters whom Baudelaire once praised as the backbone of Paris are now eulogized in his nostalgic poems. For Baudelaire, the city has been transformed into an anthill of identical bourgeois that reflect the new identical structures that litter a Paris he once called home but can now no longer recognize
</p>

<p>
The author and the publisher were prosecuted under the regime of the Second Empire as an outrage aux bonnes m&#230urs ("an insult to public decency"). As a consequence of this prosecution, Baudelaire was fined 300 francs. Six poems from the work were suppressed and the ban on their publication was not lifted in France until 1949.
Upon reading "The Swan" (or "Le Cygne") from Les Fleurs du mal, Victor Hugo announced that Baudelaire had created "un nouveau frisson" (a new shudder, a new thrill) in literature.
In the wake of the prosecution, a second edition was issued in 1861 which added 35 new poems, removed the six suppressed poems, and added a new section entitled Tableaux Parisiens.
A posthumous third edition, with a preface by Th&#233ophile Gautier and including 14 previously unpublished poems, was issued in 1868.

  <p>
  Many of Baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time. He wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters.
  </p>

<br>
<p1>Politics</p1>

<p>
Along with Poe, Baudelaire named the arch-reactionary Joseph de Maistre as his ma&#238tre &#224 penser and adopted increasingly aristocratic views. In his journals, he wrote, "There is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. A monarchy or a republic, based upon democracy, are equally absurd and feeble. The immense nausea of advertisements. There are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. To know, to kill and to create. The rest of mankind may be taxed and drudged, they are born for the stable, that is to say, to practise what they call professions."
</p>

<br>
<p1>The public</p1>

<p>
"In this regards, my friend, you're like the public, to whom one should never offer a delicate perfume. It exasperates them. Give them only carefully selected garbage."
</p>

<p1>Time</p1>

<p>
"The will to work must dominate, for art is long and time is brief."
</p>
<p>
"Each man bears within himself his own dose of natural opium, incessantly secreted and renewed, and, from birth to death, how many hours can we count filled with pleasure, with prosperous and effective action?"
</p>

<p1>Love</p1>

<p>
"There is an invincible taste for prostitution in the heart of man, from which comes his horror of solitude. He wants to be 'two'. The man of genius wants to be 'one'.... It is this horror of solitude, the need to lose oneself in the external flesh, that man nobly calls 'the need to love'."
</p>

<p1>Marriage</p1>

<p>
"Unable to suppress love, the Church wanted at least to disinfect it, and it created marriage."
</p>

<p1>The artist</p1>

<p>
 "The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes.... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses. To copulate is to enter into another—and the artist never emerges from himself."
</p>

<p1>Pleasure</p1>

<p>
"Personally, I think that the unique and supreme delight lies in the certainty of doing 'evil'–and men and women know from birth that all pleasure lies in evil."
